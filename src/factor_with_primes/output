This is a program to factorize input n.
If you receive Segmentation error when executing, it means that you don't have enough RAM capacity to hold prime numbers

Before starting the factorization, the system performance test shoukd be performed.
It is necessary for accurate approximations of runtime.
However if you don't want to run the performance test, it's up to you. Run it? (Y/n) Y
Starting the performance test...
Finished successfully.
Operations per second for your computer : 640449646.

Expectations: 
	Approximation : 
		In worst-case scenario, it will take 23448.878468 seconds or 0 day(s)
	In reality : 
		In worst-case scenario, it will take 26481.265587 seconds or 0 day(s)

Primes are : 7927 and 8831
